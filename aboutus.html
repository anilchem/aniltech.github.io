	        <p><br>This is an educational website devoted to the students studying chemistry in class XI and
	                 XII in India.
	                The content is related to syllabus of chemistry set by different boards of secondary education 
	                in different states of India.
	                If any student finds it useful to him I shall think my effort have not gone waste and he or she may
	                write comment or review. Questions related to syllabus are most welcome here.They will definitely be 
	                answered.
	                Although there is lot of chemistry content there on internet yet I dared to put forth something
	                 in my own way.
	                Your feedback and suggestions are most welcome<br>
