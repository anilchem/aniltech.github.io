	             <h2>What is Chemistry</h2>
	             <p>The branch of science which deals with the study of composition,structure,changes,physical
	              and chemical properties of matter is called chemistry.It is based on researches made by scientists.
	              Its study began in 3000BC in 
	              ancient period .It developed in China,India,Egypt,Greece.Period from 1774 till now is called Modern 
	              period.In this period it was developed  by experiments done 
	              by Lavosier,Dalton Avogadro,Wohler,Madam Curie etc. Lavosier is called Father of Chemistry </p><br><br>
                  <h2>Branches of Chemistry</h2>
                  <p>1-Physical chemistry<br>
					2-Organic chemistry<br>
					3-Inorganic chemistry<br>
					4-Biochemistry<br>
					5-Analytical chemistry<br><br><br>
					Physical Chemistry<br><br>
					This is a chemistry branch which studies the physical properties of chemical compounds
					 by the use of concepts and laws of physics, such as time, motion, thermodynamics, energy, 
					 statistical mechanics and dynamics, force and quantum chemistry. These physical properties of
					  chemical compounds include Pressure, temperature, plasticity, electrical conductivity, volume, 
					  viscosity, tensile strength, color, melting and boiling points.

					Physical chemists use mathematical models and formulas to quantify these physical properties of
					 chemical substances. Also, they can determine the effects of certain phenomena on these physical
					  properties of chemical substances.<br><br>

					Organic Chemistry<br><br>
					Organic chemistry deals with chemical compounds that contain in the element carbon and the
					 carbon-hydrogen bonds. The organic chemists seek to comprehend the properties, types of reactions
					  and the structural behaviour which such compounds undergo. Through such understanding, they are 
					  able not only identify and classify different naturally occurring compounds but also create some
					   organic compounds which have desired functions and properties. Organic chemistry is the mastermind
					    many industries such as rubber, fuel, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, plastics, agrichemicals, detergents,
					     coatings, and dyestuffs industries.<br><br>

					Inorganic Chemistry<br><br>
					Inorganic chemistry unlike organic chemistry, strive to study all the properties and reactions of chemical
					 compounds that lack the C-H bonds. In simple terms, the chemical compounds studied by inorganic chemistry
					  are not organic. These inorganic compounds include non-living matter and minerals found in the crust of 
					  the earth.<br><br>

					Biochemistry<br><br>
					This branch of chemistry deals with the composition, chemical reactions, and structures of chemical components
					 found in living systems such as the animals and plants. The primary reason for the study of these chemical 
					 components is to understand why and how these chemical reactions occur to them.

					As the name suggests, biochemistry combines biology with inorganic, organic and chemistry to understand how 
					issues such as the chemical basis of heredity, changes in diseases, etc.
	
					This branch of chemistry is widely used in the application of veterinary medicine, food science, agriculture, 
					and dentistry. Other fields that apply biochemistry include microbiology, clinical chemistry, and physiology.<br><br>

					Analytical chemistry<br><br>
					This branch of chemistry studies the identification, quantification, and separation of chemical substances
					 in a given sample. I.e., knowledge of analytical chemistry helps chemists to determine chemical substances
					  in a given material.<br>

					Analytical chemistry involves two aspects namely:<br>
	
				1-Qualitative analysis<br>
				2-Quantitative analysis
